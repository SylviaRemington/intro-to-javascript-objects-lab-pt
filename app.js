//It's taking me longer than normal to understand the concepts behind the game to understand what I am trying to create.

/*
Exercise 1
Spend some time inspecting the pokemon array by running the following command:

Copy
console.dir(pokemon, { maxArrayLength: null })
In this lab, we’re using a method you might be unfamiliar with: console.dir(). We’re using it here so that you can see all of the Pokemon in the console. Normally, both console.dir() and console.log() show only the first 100 items in an array. However, by using { maxArrayLength: null } with console.dir(), we can display every item in the array. This specific option isn’t available with console.log(), making console.dir() the necessary choice for the full visibility needed in this lab.

Take note of the shape of the data here. Each Pokemon object in the array has the following properties:

Number: A number between 1 and 151.
Name: A string representing the Pokémon’s name.
Type: A string indicating the Pokémon’s type.
HP (Hit Points): A numerical value representing the Pokémon’s health.
Starter: A boolean indicating whether the Pokémon is a starter.
There’s some game-specific terminology here, if you’re new to Pokémon, here’s an explanation of the terms used in the game:

Number: Each Pokémon has a unique number as its identifier.
Type: This refers to a Pokémon’s primary abilities. While Pokémon can have multiple types, we’re focusing on their primary type here for simplicity.
Hit Points (HP): This is a measure of a Pokémon’s health, expressed in a numerical value.
Starter Pokémon: At the beginning of the game, players choose a starting Pokémon. In our data, starter Pokémon are marked with a starter property set to true.
The starter Pokémon options are:

Pokémon 1: Bulbasaur
Pokémon 4: Charmander
Pokémon 7: Squirtle
Pokémon 25: Pikachu
When you’ve completed your inspection of the data, you can comment out the console.dir() method and use console.log() to log JUST the name of the Pokemon with the number 59 using the index of the Pokemon in the array. Feel free to uncomment the console.dir() as needed to help you complete the rest of the lab.

Exercise 2
Next, add the following console.log:

Run the following:

console.log(game)
Take a moment to familiarize yourself with the game object being logged. It has four properties: party, gyms, and items. All of these hold or will hold an array of objects.

As you move through the exercises:

game.party will hold an array of Pokemon objects that will be retrieved from the pokemon array we reviewed in Exercise 1. These are Pokemon that you have caught!
game.gyms holds an array of objects, each representing a gym (checkpoints placed throughout the game). Note the completed boolean property on each. This will be important later.
game.items holds an array of objects, each representing an item in a player’s inventory.
When you’ve completed your inspection of the data, you can comment out the console.log and move on to Exercise 3. Feel free to uncomment the console.log as needed to help you complete the rest of the lab.

Exercise 6

//First attempt... incorrect... not sure why... looking into it
//I think I'm really confused as to how to interact with Objects. Gonna re-watch class again.

//Uncaught SyntaxError: Illegal return statement (at app.js:185:3)
// Notes from chatgpt about above code and trying to explain why it doesn't work and giving me hints, 
// but I still don't understand the chatgpt explanation. lol
// 1. game.gyms is a list of gyms, not just one gym. You need to look at each gym one at a time.
// 2. You wrote game.gyms.difficulty, but that doesn’t work because gyms is a list. You need to write something like game.gyms[i].difficulty to get the difficulty of one gym.
// 3. return only works inside a function. You’re not inside a function, so you can’t use return here.
// 4. Your for loop condition is wrong. A loop needs to know when to stop (like i < 10 or i < game.gyms.length), not a condition like game.gyms.difficulty < 3.
// 5. To change something in each gym, you have to go through the list and change one gym at a time using game.gyms[i].completed = true.

//Second attempt
//Thinking of trying a for...loop and/or a forEach loop:
//Pseudo code:
// I want the loop to loop through the OBJECTS WITHIN THE GYMS
//The gyms is an object that has an array and then lines of objects within it. I want to loop through the lines of objects.

// What it's asking you to do:
// 1. Look at each gym in the game.gyms array.
// 2. If the gym's difficulty is less than 3 (so difficulty 1 or 2), then: → Change that gym’s completed value to true.

// What you’ll need to do:
// 1. Go through each gym one by one (use a loop).
// 2. Check if that gym’s difficulty is below 3.
// 3. If it is, change its completed from false to true.

// Next attempt - had error message... but closer... I realized I needed to get to gym and not be referencing from the outside.

/*
Exercise 7
1. Evolve the starter Pokémon you added to your party earlier. Each starter Pokémon evolves into a specific one.
2. How would you replace the current starter Pokémon in your party with its evolved form?

Hint: 
  - Pokemon 1: Bulbasaur evolves into Pokemon 2: Ivysaur
  - Pokemon 4: Charmander evolves into Pokemon 5: Charmeleon
  - Pokemon 7: Squirtle evolves into Pokemon 8: Wartortle
  - Pokemon 25: Pikachu evolves into Pokemon 26: Raichu

More Hints: The existing starter Pokemon will be *replaced* in your party with the Pokemon it evolved into. When working with an array of objects, the splice() array method is ideal for replacing one element with another. 

More notes from chaptgpt to understand what's going on:

What does "evolve the starter Pokémon" mean?
In Pokémon, evolving means: Replacing a Pokémon with its stronger, next version.
For example: Bulbasaur → Ivysaur, or Pikachu → Raichu
So you're not adding a new Pokémon — you're swapping the old one with its evolved form.

What you're supposed to do:
Look in your game.party array.
Find the starter Pokémon you added earlier (like Pikachu, Bulbasaur, etc.)
Replace that exact Pokémon with the one it evolves into (like Raichu or Ivysaur).

So my current game.party is the following: 
0: {number: 4, name: 'Charmander', type: 'fire', hp: 39, starter: true}
1: {number: 1, name: 'Bulbasaur', type: 'grass', hp: 45, starter: true}
2: {number: 7, name: 'Squirtle', type: 'water', hp: 44, starter: true}
3: {number: 25, name: 'Pikachu', type: 'electric', hp: 35, starter: true}
length: 4
[[Prototype]]: Array(0)

Solve Exercise 7 here:
*/

console.log(game.party);

//going to use splice method to switch these players out to the next evolved player
//going to remove one pokemon from game.party and insert a different one

game.party.splice(0, 1, pokemon[4]);
//Pokemon 4 which I currently have at index 0 in party. Charmander evolves into Pokemon 5: Charmeleon (and Charmeleon is at index 4 in pokemon).
console.log(game.party); //making sure I've taken out Charmander and replaced with Charmeleon.

game.party.splice(1, 1, pokemon[1]);
//  - Pokemon 1: Bulbasaur evolves into Pokemon 2: Ivysaur / B is in index1 in party and replacing with pokemon index 1
console.log(game.party);

game.party.splice(2, 1, pokemon[7]);
//- Pokemon 7: Squirtle evolves into Pokemon 8: Wartortle / S is in index2 in party and replacing with pokemon index 7
console.log(game.party);

game.party.splice(3, 1, pokemon[25]);
// - Pokemon 25: Pikachu evolves into Pokemon 26: Raichu / P is in index3 in party and replacing with pokemon index 25
console.log(game.party);


//Another option:
// To make the code more dynamic and more reuseable, you can do:
// const evolutions = [
//   { starterNumber: 1, evolvedNumber: 2 },   // Bulbasaur → Ivysaur
//   { starterNumber: 4, evolvedNumber: 5 },   // Charmander → Charmeleon
//   { starterNumber: 7, evolvedNumber: 8 },   // Squirtle → Wartortle
//   { starterNumber: 25, evolvedNumber: 26 }  // Pikachu → Raichu
// ];

// game.party.forEach(function(pokemon, index) {
//   if (pokemon.number === 1) {
//     game.party.splice(index, 1, pokemon[1]); // Ivysaur
//   } else if (pokemon.number === 4) {
//     game.party.splice(index, 1, pokemon[5]); // Charmeleon
//   } else if (pokemon.number === 7) {
//     game.party.splice(index, 1, pokemon[8]); // Wartortle
//   } else if (pokemon.number === 25) {
//     game.party.splice(index, 1, pokemon[26]); // Raichu
//   }
// });

// console.log("Evolved party:", game.party);

//wait, maybe this isn't reusable... How would I make this reuseable for the future? I'm still figuring this out.

//Yet another option                            //I'm explaining it for myself in case I need to reference later
// const evolutions = [                         //Here I created a variable named evolutions that will hold an array of objects
//   { starterNumber: 1, evolvedNumber: 2 },   // Bulbasaur → Ivysaur //If pokemon has a starter number (original number) of 1, will evolve to an evolved number (aka new pokemon number)
//   { starterNumber: 4, evolvedNumber: 5 },   // Charmander → Charmeleon //4 becomes 5 (similar to last line)
//   { starterNumber: 7, evolvedNumber: 8 },   // Squirtle → Wartortle //7 becomes 8
//   { starterNumber: 25, evolvedNumber: 26 }  // Pikachu → Raichu// 25 becomes 26
// ];

// game.party.forEach(function(pokemon, index) { 
//Starting a forEach loop through the game.party array
//Starting at my current Pokemon team (game.party), forEach to loop through each Pokemon
// then with (function(pokemon, index), for every pokemon, pokemon is the current pokemon looking at, and index is the index

//   evolutions.forEach(function(evolution) { //for the list of all the possible starterNumber:evolvedNumber pairs, loop through
//     if (pokemon.number === evolution.starterNumber) { //if pokemon equals the starter number, splice on the next line

// Notes from chatgpt about why we're doing this:
// Why are you copying the method? Because the exercise wants you to modify the original method to do something extra:
// Before: catchPokemon only added a Pokémon to the party.
// Now: You need to also subtract 1 from the pokeball quantity every time the function runs.
// So you're copying the original version so you can add to it without rewriting everything from scratch.

// 🔹 Why are we changing catchPokemon instead of writing a new function?
// Because this task is about catching a Pokémon — the exact same job as the original function.
// You're just adding new behavior to the existing function:“When catching, also reduce pokeballs by 1.”

// 🔹 So why is game.items involved now?
// Because game.items is where your inventory is stored.
// Pokeballs live there.

// You’ll need to look inside game.items, find the pokeball, and subtract 1 from its quantity.

//Pasted from above
//First attempt at exercise... when calling the function this way, I get error message: 
// app.js:539 Uncaught ReferenceError: items is not defined at app.js:539:19

// First Attempt Below
// game.catchPokemon = function(pokemonObj) {
//   game.party.push(pokemonObj);
//   if (catchPokemon === true) {
//     game.items = game.items -1;
//   }
// };
// game.catchPokemon(items); 
// console.log(game.party);

//Not sure where to go from here.
//This is as far as I got with this assignment. I've been working on it from April 9th-13th and rewatching Objects lecture and Arrays lecture. 
// This is the best I can do so far. For some reason, Objects and this objects lab isn't clicking for me yet. 
// I'm kinda confused as to how to combine everything I know for this lab. I hope I can still get credit for this lab. Doing the best I can.


// Notes for me:
// If have time after going through HTML & CSS Video Watch assignment, 
// look into the "this" method and review Objects lecture again. 
// Also, look into "find" method and find more info about that.
// So far have done Exercises 1-10 correctly. Still working on Ex 11, and will keep working on this until assignment due on Monday, April 14th.
// Is it normal to take this long to understand this assignment? Am I too slow or stupid to code? Or is this normal to struggle when learning this?
//I've never had such a hard time learning a subject before. Normally, I learn subjects quickly.


//Exercises 1-11 completed //will continue to work on this lab for my own knowledge of Objects.
//I'm aware this is as far as I could get in this particular lab for the deadline to turn this in. I just need more practice, which will come with time.

/*
Exercise 13
1. Create a `gymStatus` method in `game` to tally completed and incomplete gyms.
2. How will you iterate through the `gyms` array and update the tally? Remember to log the final tally.

This method should:
  - Not accept any arguments.
  - Initially create a constant `gymTally`, which is an object that has two 
    properties: `completed` and `incomplete`, both of which are initially set to 0.
  - Iterate through the objects in the `game.gyms` array and update the 
    properties on `gymTally` as follows: 
    - `completed` should count how many gyms in the array have a value of `true` 
      for their `completed` property. 
    - `incomplete` should count how many gyms in the array have a value of 
      `false` for their `completed` property.
  - Log the value of `gymTally`.
  - The method should not return anything.

For example, if five gym objects have a value of `true` on their `completed` property and three gym objects have a value of `false` on their `completed` property, the logged value would be: `{ completed: 5, incomplete: 3 }`.

Exercise 18
Add a new property to the `game` object called `collection` and initialize its value to an empty array.

Copy the `catchPokemon` method you wrote in Exercise Twelve and paste it below. Modify it so that:
  - Ensure that no more than six Pokemon can be in the party at any time. 
    Excess Pokemon should be placed in the `game.collection` array.
  - It's up to you how to distribute Pokemon in a situation where more than six 
    would be placed into the `game.party` array.

Again, for this exercise, it's okay to have a negative number of pokeballs.

After updating the method, use it by calling it and passing in a pokemon object of your choice from the `pokemon` data to catch it.

Also, log the `game.items` array to confirm that the pokeball quantity is being decremented.

Exercise 19
Copy the `catchPokemon` method that you just wrote above, and paste it below. The time has come to make it so that we cannot catch a Pokemon when we do not have any pokeballs to catch it with. 

Modify the method so that if there are no pokeballs a message will be displayed that there are not enough pokeballs to catch the desired Pokemon.

Also, ensure that the Pokemon isn't added to the `game.party` or the `game.collection`.

Exercise 20
Copy the `catchPokemon` method that you just wrote above, and paste it below. Modify is so that you can just pass in the name of a Pokemon instead of an entire object, and the method will look up the Pokemon from the data set for you.

The string passed in should be allowed to be any case (for example, if the string 'PiKacHU' is passed to the function, it should match to 'Pikachu' in the data set). 

If there is not a match, then return a string noting that the selected Pokemon does not exist. Ensure you do not decrement the pokeball count if an invalid Pokemon name is passed in, and also ensure that the Pokemon isn't added to the `game.party` or the `game.collection`.

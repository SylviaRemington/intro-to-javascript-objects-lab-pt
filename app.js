//Uncaught SyntaxError: Illegal return statement (at app.js:185:3)
// Notes from chatgpt about above code and trying to explain why it doesn't work and giving me hints, 
// but I still don't understand the chatgpt explanation. lol
// 1. game.gyms is a list of gyms, not just one gym. You need to look at each gym one at a time.
// 2. You wrote game.gyms.difficulty, but that doesn’t work because gyms is a list. You need to write something like game.gyms[i].difficulty to get the difficulty of one gym.
// 3. return only works inside a function. You’re not inside a function, so you can’t use return here.
// 4. Your for loop condition is wrong. A loop needs to know when to stop (like i < 10 or i < game.gyms.length), not a condition like game.gyms.difficulty < 3.
// 5. To change something in each gym, you have to go through the list and change one gym at a time using game.gyms[i].completed = true.

//Second attempt
//Thinking of trying a for...loop and/or a forEach loop:
//Pseudo code:
// I want the loop to loop through the OBJECTS WITHIN THE GYMS

// 1. Look at each gym in the game.gyms array.
// 2. If the gym's difficulty is less than 3 (so difficulty 1 or 2), then: → Change that gym’s completed value to true.

// What you’ll need to do:
// 1. Go through each gym one by one (use a loop).
// 2. Check if that gym’s difficulty is below 3.

Exercise 7
1. Evolve the starter Pokémon you added to your party earlier. Each starter Pokémon evolves into a specific one.
2. How would you replace the current starter Pokémon in your party with its evolved form?

Hint: 
  - Pokemon 1: Bulbasaur evolves into Pokemon 2: Ivysaur
  - Pokemon 4: Charmander evolves into Pokemon 5: Charmeleon
  - Pokemon 7: Squirtle evolves into Pokemon 8: Wartortle
  - Pokemon 25: Pikachu evolves into Pokemon 26: Raichu

More Hints: The existing starter Pokemon will be *replaced* in your party with the Pokemon it evolved into. When working with an array of objects, the splice() array method is ideal for replacing one element with another. 

More notes from chaptgpt to understand what's going on:

What does "evolve the starter Pokémon" mean?
In Pokémon, evolving means: Replacing a Pokémon with its stronger, next version.
For example: Bulbasaur → Ivysaur, or Pikachu → Raichu
So you're not adding a new Pokémon — you're swapping the old one with its evolved form.

What you're supposed to do:
Look in your game.party array.
Find the starter Pokémon you added earlier (like Pikachu, Bulbasaur, etc.)
Replace that exact Pokémon with the one it evolves into (like Raichu or Ivysaur).

So my current game.party is the following: 
0: {number: 4, name: 'Charmander', type: 'fire', hp: 39, starter: true}
1: {number: 1, name: 'Bulbasaur', type: 'grass', hp: 45, starter: true}
2: {number: 7, name: 'Squirtle', type: 'water', hp: 44, starter: true}
3: {number: 25, name: 'Pikachu', type: 'electric', hp: 35, starter: true}
length: 4
[[Prototype]]: Array(0)

Solve Exercise 7 here:
*/

console.log(game.party);

//going to use splice method to switch these players out to the next evolved player
//going to remove one pokemon from game.party and insert a different one

game.party.splice(0, 1, pokemon[4]);
//Pokemon 4 which I currently have at index 0 in party. Charmander evolves into Pokemon 5: Charmeleon (and Charmeleon is at index 4 in pokemon).
console.log(game.party); //making sure I've taken out Charmander and replaced with Charmeleon.

game.party.splice(1, 1, pokemon[1]);
//  - Pokemon 1: Bulbasaur evolves into Pokemon 2: Ivysaur / B is in index1 in party and replacing with pokemon index 1
console.log(game.party);

game.party.splice(2, 1, pokemon[7]);
//- Pokemon 7: Squirtle evolves into Pokemon 8: Wartortle / S is in index2 in party and replacing with pokemon index 7
console.log(game.party);

game.party.splice(3, 1, pokemon[25]);
// - Pokemon 25: Pikachu evolves into Pokemon 26: Raichu / P is in index3 in party and replacing with pokemon index 25
console.log(game.party);


//Another option:
// To make the code more dynamic and more reuseable, you can do:
// const evolutions = [
//   { starterNumber: 1, evolvedNumber: 2 },   // Bulbasaur → Ivysaur
//   { starterNumber: 4, evolvedNumber: 5 },   // Charmander → Charmeleon
//   { starterNumber: 7, evolvedNumber: 8 },   // Squirtle → Wartortle
//   { starterNumber: 25, evolvedNumber: 26 }  // Pikachu → Raichu
// ];

// game.party.forEach(function(pokemon, index) {
//   if (pokemon.number === 1) {
//     game.party.splice(index, 1, pokemon[1]); // Ivysaur
//   } else if (pokemon.number === 4) {
//     game.party.splice(index, 1, pokemon[5]); // Charmeleon
//   } else if (pokemon.number === 7) {
//     game.party.splice(index, 1, pokemon[8]); // Wartortle
//   } else if (pokemon.number === 25) {
//     game.party.splice(index, 1, pokemon[26]); // Raichu
//   }
// });

// console.log("Evolved party:", game.party);

//wait, maybe this isn't reusable... How would I make this reuseable for the future? I'm still figuring this out.

//Yet another option                            //I'm explaining it for myself in case I need to reference later
// const evolutions = [                         //Here I created a variable named evolutions that will hold an array of objects
//   { starterNumber: 1, evolvedNumber: 2 },   // Bulbasaur → Ivysaur //If pokemon has a starter number (original number) of 1, will evolve to an evolved number (aka new pokemon number)
//   { starterNumber: 4, evolvedNumber: 5 },   // Charmander → Charmeleon //4 becomes 5 (similar to last line)
//   { starterNumber: 7, evolvedNumber: 8 },   // Squirtle → Wartortle //7 becomes 8
//   { starterNumber: 25, evolvedNumber: 26 }  // Pikachu → Raichu// 25 becomes 26
// ];

// game.party.forEach(function(pokemon, index) { 
//Starting a forEach loop through the game.party array
//Starting at my current Pokemon team (game.party), forEach to loop through each Pokemon
// then with (function(pokemon, index), for every pokemon, pokemon is the current pokemon looking at, and index is the index

//   evolutions.forEach(function(evolution) { //for the list of all the possible starterNumber:evolvedNumber pairs, loop through
//     if (pokemon.number === evolution.starterNumber) { //if pokemon equals the starter number, splice on the next line
//       game.party.splice(index, 1, pokemon[evolution.evolvedNumber]);
//     }
//   });
// });

//I'm not sure if I'm doing this exercise right. 
//I don't get why we copy and paste this catchMethod here, when we are focusing on games.items and pokeball quantity.

// Notes from chatgpt about why we're doing this:
// Why are you copying the method? Because the exercise wants you to modify the original method to do something extra:
// Before: catchPokemon only added a Pokémon to the party.
// Now: You need to also subtract 1 from the pokeball quantity every time the function runs.
// So you're copying the original version so you can add to it without rewriting everything from scratch.

// 🔹 Why are we changing catchPokemon instead of writing a new function?
// Because this task is about catching a Pokémon — the exact same job as the original function.
// You're just adding new behavior to the existing function:“When catching, also reduce pokeballs by 1.”

// 🔹 So why is game.items involved now?
// Because game.items is where your inventory is stored.
// Pokeballs live there.

// You’ll need to look inside game.items, find the pokeball, and subtract 1 from its quantity.

//Pasted from above
